This is the github.io website for letvargo. The original website, http://letvargo.mooo.com is down indefinitely due to technical difficulties.

Unfortunately, my server died and I have not yet been able to recover the posts that I had saved on it. I hope to recover some of the content eventually, but for now I'm starting over with a fresh jekyll-powered website hosted here on GitHub.

More is to come.

{% highlight swift %}

// This is a code-block test

func testfun() -> () {
    print("This is a test.")
}

{% endhighlight %}
    
And this is some `inline code`.

A bullet list looks like this:

* item
* item
* item
  1. with some numbered items
  2. that go here

A gist should go here:

{% gist letvargo/138109b9febfcb8bebbf main.swift %}
