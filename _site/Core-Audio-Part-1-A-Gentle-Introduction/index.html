        <h1>Core Audio and Swift Part 1 - A Gentle Introduction</h1>
            
        <p>Core Audio can be intimidating. The API is complex and the documentation is sparse. For someone like me who has no background in C, the low-level C style functions look like, well... a foreign language.</p>

<p>This post is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the most basic Core Audio operations. You&#39;ll learn how to open an audio file, examine its properties, and query it for information like album artwork, the artist&#39;s name, the duration of the audio, etc.</p>

<p>The examples in this post are based on an example in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Core-Audio-Hands-On-Programming/dp/0321636848">&quot;Learning Core Audio&quot;</a>, available on Amazon. It is a great book, with many useful examples written in Objective-C. If you are interested in Core Audio, I recommend getting a copy.</p>

<h2>Opening an Audio File in Core Audio</h2>

<p>We&#39;re going to be using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/AudioFileConvertRef/">Audio File Services</a> framework. Audio File Services is a part of the <code>AudioToolbox</code> framework. According to Apple, Audio File Services is...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...a C programming interface that enables you to read or write a wide variety of audio data to or from disk or a memory buffer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the simplest things you can do with Audio File Services is open an audio file and get information about the contents of the file. It makes for a good introduction to some of the peculiarities of how Core Audio works. </p>

<p>To work with Audio File Services, you need to include the line,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import AudioToolbox
</code></pre></div>
<p>at the top of any files that make use of it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s jump right in with some code. The function that you use to open an audio file is called <code>AudioFileOpenURL</code>, and it looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">func AudioFileOpenURL(
      _ inFileRef: CFURL
    , _ inPermissions: AudioFilePermissions
    , _ inFileTypeHint: AudioFileTypeID
    , _ outAudioFile: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;AudioFileID&gt; ) -&gt; OSStatus
</code></pre></div>
<p>Take a look at the parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>inFileRef</code>: The URL of the file you want to load.</li>
<li><code>inPermissions</code>: A permission parameter, either <code>.ReadPermission</code>, <code>.WritePermission</code>, or <code>ReadWritePermission</code>.</li>
<li><code>inFileTypeHint</code>: A hint to help identify the file type. Passing <code>0</code> (no hint) is fine at this stage of the game.</li>
<li><code>outAudioFile</code>: A pointer to the audio file that will created.</li>
</ul>

<p>The return value is an <code>OSStatus</code>, which is a <code>typealias</code> for <code>Int32</code>. The <code>OSStatus</code> code will be <code>0</code>, aka <code>noErr</code>, if there were no errors. Otherwise, it will be an <code>Int32</code> value that corresponds to a particular error. There will be more talk about error codes in the next few posts.</p>

<p>The first thing we need is a URL. Pick a file, any file, from your iTunes library and create a <code>String</code> to hold the file path and turn it into a <code>NSURL</code>. I&#39;m going with some INXS, but it works for sucky music too:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">let filePath = &quot;/Users/doofnugget/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/INXS/Kick/02 New Sensation.m4a&quot;

let url = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: filePath)
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>outAudioFile</code> parameter is an <code>UnsafeMutablePointer</code> to an <code>AudioFileID</code>. You pass the pointer in and Audio File Services fills it in with the information from the audio file that you are opening. To pass a pointer to an <code>AudioFileID</code> all you have to do is initialize one as a <code>var</code> and pass it in using <code>&amp;</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">var audioFile = AudioFileID()
var status = AudioFileOpenURL(url, .ReadPermission, 0, &amp;audioFile)

if status != noErr { 
    print(&quot;An error occurred while opening the audio file: Error code \(status).&quot;) 
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>audioFile</code> is now a pointer to the file that we can use to get information about it.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>OSStatus</code> value that was returned from <code>AudioFileOpenURL</code> is used to determine if any errors occurred while the file was being opened. Error checking with Core Audio can be quite involved, but for now we&#39;ll just print a helpful message and the error code whenever an error occurs.</p>

<p>What we just did is a very common pattern when you are working with Core Audio. You initialize a data type like an <code>AudioFileID</code>, and then you pass a pointer to it into a Core Audio function. The function modifies the properties of the object, usually by copying in or modifying some piece of useful information. You can think of the <code>UnsafeMutablePointer</code> parameters like <code>inout</code> parameters. The object that is passed in is modified by the function.</p>

<h2>Getting Property Size Information</h2>

<p><code>AudioFileID</code> is a <code>typealias</code> for a <code>COpaquePointer</code>. The word &quot;opaque&quot; is fitting. You cannot directly access any of the <code>AudioFileID</code>s properties. For example, every <code>AudioFileID</code> has a property that represents the estimated duration of the audio file. But you can&#39;t access it the way you would normally access an object&#39;s properties. This doesn&#39;t work:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">let duration = audioFile.estimatedDuration
</code></pre></div>
<p>No, the process for getting property information is somewhat more complex. It has two parts: First, you have to get the size (a <code>UInt32</code> value that represents the property&#39;s size in bytes) of the property using <code>AudioFileGetPropertyInfo</code>. Only after you&#39;ve gotten the size can you actually query the audio file for its properties.</p>

<p><code>AudioFileGetPropertyInfo</code> looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">func AudioFileGetPropertyInfo(
      _ inAudioFile: AudioFileID
    , _ inPropertyID: AudioFilePropertyID
    , _ outDataSize: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt32&gt;
    , _ isWritable: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt32&gt; ) -&gt; OSStatus
</code></pre></div>
<p>So let&#39;s do it. We&#39;re going to get the audio file&#39;s &quot;info dictionary&quot; property. The info dictionary is a <code>NSDictionary</code> that contains information like the artist&#39;s name, the tempo, the album name, the year that the song came out, etc.</p>

<p>Here is what the code looks like for getting the size of the property that we are going to access:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">var size: UInt32 = 0                         // 1
status = AudioFileGetPropertyInfo(
      audioFile                              // 2
    , kAudioFilePropertyInfoDictionary       // 3
    , &amp;size                                  // 4
    , nil )                                  // 5

if status != noErr {                         // 6
    print(&quot;An error occurred while getting the info dictionary property size: Error code \(status).&quot;) 
}
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
<li>We create a <code>UInt32</code> value called <code>size</code> and initialize it with a dummy value of <code>0</code>. </li>
<li>The first parameter of the function is the audio file that we want to query. </li>
<li>The second parameter is a constant, <code>kAudioFilePropertyInfoDictionary</code>, that identifies the property that we are asking about. </li>
<li>The third parameter is a pointer to the <code>size</code> variable that we created. When the function returns, <code>size</code> will contain the actual size of the property. </li>
<li>The last parameter, <code>isWritable</code>, can be used to ask whether or not the property is read-only or if it can be written. We are not interested in that right now, and so we pass <code>nil</code>.</li>
<li>Last, we check to see if any errors occurred. If so, we print out a helpful message along with the error code.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Accessing the Property</h2>

<p>Now that we have the property&#39;s size stored away in our <code>size</code> variable, we can actually ask the audio file to give us the property data. The function for getting the property data is called <code>AudioFileGetProperty</code>, and it looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">func AudioFileGetProperty(
      _ inAudioFile: AudioFileID
    , _ inPropertyID: AudioFilePropertyID
    , _ ioDataSize: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt32&gt;
    , _ outPropertyData: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;Void&gt; ) -&gt; OSStatus
</code></pre></div>
<p>And this is the code for actually retrieving the dictionary information:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">var infoDictionary = NSDictionary()          // 1
status = AudioFileGetProperty(
      audioFile                              // 2
    , kAudioFilePropertyInfoDictionary       // 3
    , &amp;size                                  // 4
    , &amp;infoDictionary )                      // 5

if status != noErr {                         // 6
    print(&quot;An error occurred while getting the info dictionary property: Error code \(status).&quot;) 
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This should all be starting to look a little familiar by now. </p>

<ol>
<li>Create a dummy dictionary to hold the data.</li>
<li>Pass in the audio file that we are querying.</li>
<li>Pass in the property identifier constant.</li>
<li>Pass in a pointer to the size of the property</li>
<li>Pass in a pointer to the dummy dictionary.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the function returns, <code>infoDictionary</code> will be populated with the data that we were looking for (artist name, album, song title, etc.) This is the output that I get when I print the info dictionary for the file that I opened:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{
    album = Kick;
    &quot;approximate duration in seconds&quot; = &quot;220.192&quot;;
    artist = INXS;
    genre = Rock;
    title = &quot;New Sensation&quot;;
    &quot;track number&quot; = &quot;2/12&quot;;
    year = 1988;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Audio File Services contains a number of constants that represent the possible keys in this dictionary. For example, the key for retrieving the artist&#39;s name is <code>kAFInfoDictionary_Artist</code>. Use the keys to get specific information like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">if let artist = infoDictionary[kAFInfoDictionary_Artist] {
    print(artist)             // Output: &quot;INXS&quot;
}
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&#39;s a very simple introduction to Audio File Services. Getting and setting an audio file&#39;s properties is a common task. Once you get past the strangeness of these C functions it is pretty straightforward. (Strange, at least, to someone like me without a background in C.)</p>

<p>There are, of course, many more things you can do with it. There are functions for reading and writing data and creating new audio files, among other things. And <code>AudioToolbox</code> offers many other services as well, including Audio Queue Services which you can use to record and playback audio. But for today, we&#39;re done. Thanks for reading!</p>
