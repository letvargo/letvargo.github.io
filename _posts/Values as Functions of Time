# Values as Functions of Time

A constant is a value that remains the same no matter what time it is. In other words, a constant is a function of type *Time -> Value* where the *Time* parameter is ignored. The number `5`, for instance could be written as a function like this:

	let five: Time -> Int = { _ in 5 }
	
	

## Simple Values

    extension Int: BehaviorType {
        var at: Time -> Value = {
            return { _ in self }
        }
        
        var time: Time? {
            return nil
        }
    }
